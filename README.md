🛒 E-commerce Playwright POM Framework
A scalable end-to-end UI automation framework built using Playwright Test and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for an ecommerce web application.
This project demonstrates clean test architecture, reusable page components, data-driven execution, and cross-browser validation — structured for real-world maintainability and CI/CD integration.

Key Highlights
✔ Page Object Model (POM) architecture
✔ Clear separation between test logic and page implementation
✔ Data-driven login using external JSON
✔ Cross-browser execution (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Edge)
✔ HTML reporting with screenshot, video, and trace on failure
✔ CI/CD ready (GitHub Actions compatible)

🏗 Architecture Overview
Before POM
Spec file
 ├── Navigation
 ├── Locators
 ├── Actions
 └── Assertions
After POM
Spec file → Calls page methods
Page classes → Contain locators and reusable actions
Benefits
Improved maintainability
Reduced duplication
Increased scalability
Cleaner, business-readable test cases
